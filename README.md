# Odin Landing Page

A practice webpage built from the guided lesson at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). This project features HTML and CSS using flexbox techniques to practice beginning webpage styling and layout.

All modern browsers should support [this project's webpage](https://zach39908.github.io/odin-landing-page/). 

Following The Odin Project's guidelines, responsive design for small screens is not implemented in this project. This webpage is mainly for gathering experience with flexbox to design some basic layouts. Responsive design will come in to play in later projects.
